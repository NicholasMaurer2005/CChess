# CChess
This project is a rewrite/completion of my other project, "ChessConsole". I aim to write more organized, readable, and perhaps more efficient C++. My goal is to create a chess engine capable of competing against other chess engines, although I don't know if I will ever get to that point. Most of the engine was based off of "Bitboard Chess Engine" by Code Monkey King, that is where I learned how to create a bitboard chess engine.
